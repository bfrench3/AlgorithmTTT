# AlgorithmTTT
this is a java program I made that is a tic tac toe game; however I went above and beyond and made it able to run 2 players or player V computer using an algorithm
in 3 cases (easy medium and hard) each with increasing logic and cases to base moves off of. A couple custom methods were implemented out of the main method.
